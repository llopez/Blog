Luis lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He studied systems engineering at the University Of La Matanza, and he started his professional career in 2007.

His passion for the technology and how to make use of it in benefit of society keeps him in a continuous state of learning.

In his free time, he chooses spend time at open air. There must be a clear balance between the virtual and the real, he thinks.

In this blog, I will be writing mostly about technology and how to apply it beyond the common problems.

I’m always interested in hearing from colleagues, so feel free to contact me if you’d like to connect.
