I’m Luis, a __software developer__ focused on the __open source__. 

During my career I have been working with several people from whom I learned a lot, working with people is a great way to grow.

I have more than ten years of experience with __Ruby__, I have used __Ruby on Rails__ for more that 8 years, I love __linux__, the __cloud__, __IoT__, the union between the __software__ and the __hardware__.

I’m truly passionate about what I do and always eager to do it better. 

Also I’m always interested in hearing from colleagues, so feel free to contact me if you’d like to connect.

Finally, if you have an idea and you don’t know how to make it real, I will be glad to hear what you have to say.
